# Excel Reader ¬∑ AEP

Web utility that reads the Controlo de Nomea√ß√µes workbook used by the Associa√ß√£o dos Escoteiros de Portugal (AEP). The app normalises the spreadsheet, groups responsibilities by section, and offers quick copy shortcuts for every relevant name.

üìç Production deployment: https://excel-reader-aep.vercel.app/

## Highlights

- Upload `.xlsx` files entirely in the browser (no backend round-trip).
- Pick a group or n√∫cleo through a themed `react-select` dropdown with keyboard search.
- See appointments grouped by section (Chefia de Grupo, Alcateia, Tribos, Cl√£, Chefia Regional, N√∫cleo) with live vote totals.
- Use single or bulk clipboard actions to copy formatted name lists instantly.
- Styled UI that mirrors the purple gradient across buttons, selects, and the file input for consistent branding.

## Excel Input Requirements

- Supported file: the official AEP Controlo de Nomea√ß√µes workbook exported as `.xlsx`.
- Expected sheets: `All BO`, `Chefia Regional`, `N√∫cleos`, `Responsabilidades`, and `CF Regional` (matching the helper modules in `src/Components/handle-data`).
- Column headers should remain unchanged; the parser relies on exact labels set by AEP.
- Remove blank spacer columns/rows before upload if the template has been altered manually.
- The tool highlights any row that fails parsing directly in the browser console for quick debugging.

## Tech Stack

- React 19 + Vite 5
- CoreUI Pro layout components
- Sass (global tokens and BEM-style overrides)
- `read-excel-file` and `@ramonak/react-excel` for parsing and previewing data
- Vitest with Testing Library for unit and integration coverage

## Architecture Overview

```

  App.js                # Main shell that loads data and renders the layout
  Components/           # Reusable UI (copy buttons, loaders, select wrappers)
  View/                 # Top-level views (DefaultLayout, Result)
  helpers/              # Parsing helpers and list builders
  hooks/                # Custom hooks (useExcelData)
  scss/style.scss       # Global styling entry point
```

Parsing responsibilities live inside `src/Components/handle-data`, grouped by the section they serve. Clipboard helpers sit in `src/helpers`, while lists displayed in the UI are memoised in `useExcelData` to avoid unnecessary re-computation.

## Local Development

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 22 or newer (see `package.json` `engines`)
- Yarn 3 (`npm install -g yarn` if needed)

### Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Drete457/ExcelReaderAep.git
cd ExcelReaderAep
yarn install
yarn dev
```

Visit http://localhost:5173 to load the development build.

### Available Scripts

- `yarn dev` ‚Äì start the Vite dev server
- `yarn build` ‚Äì emit the production bundle
- `yarn preview` ‚Äì serve the production build locally
- `yarn test` / `yarn test:watch` ‚Äì run the Vitest suite (once or watch mode)
- `yarn lint` / `yarn lint:fix` ‚Äì run ESLint and optionally auto-fix issues
- `yarn format` / `yarn format:check` ‚Äì enforce Prettier formatting in write/check mode

## Testing & Quality

Tests live in `src/__tests__` and cover both the parsing helpers and key UI flows. `useExcelData` skips artificial loading delays when `NODE_ENV=test`, so the suite remains fast. Run `yarn test` for a single pass or `yarn test:watch` while iterating. Pair with `yarn lint` before commits to keep quality gates green.

## Deployment Notes

The production build ships through Vercel. A successful `yarn build` produces the optimized output under `dist/`. Any static hosting service that serves SPA routes can deploy the same artifact.
